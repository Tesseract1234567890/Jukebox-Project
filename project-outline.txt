Overview
-Essentially TouchTunes but for CSH. It will use Spotify (possibly Youtube)
---TouchTunes: Digital jukebox; we will have a "jukebox" website that shows song data and plays the song
   and another website for users to interact with the jukebox site
-Python with Django, HTML/CSS/JS (or another frontend language that works w/ python)
-Spotify API
----Youtube API (possibly)
Two parts:
-The “master” site that displays the current song, lyrics, and the song queue.
--- Also is in charge of playing the song and handling most API code.
--- Should connect to computer speakers IOT play audio
The user site, which allows someone to search for a song and add it to the queue
Interface will take one of 2 forms
1: User can choose between Spotify and Youtube to search for a song within that platform
2: User can search for a song, and the site will search both Spotify and Youtube and display a certain number of songs/results.



Demo to-do (Priority stuff):
---Embed player in HTML to play songs **** 
-Make code for queue (adding to queue and displaying it, editing queue) 
    --the user site will be able to see the queue (maybe not the whole queue, just the next 3 or 4 or something)
    --user site will be able to add songs to queue
-Use Django to make the website using Python
--After we make the initial site we will look into server stuff
---Meaning, after we make the host site we can make the user site and make server code to let the two sites communicate
